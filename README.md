# Domain list

A crowdfunded list of domains (including CDN hosts) belonging to ICT company silos, i.e. Facebook, Linkedin etc.

This list is useful for any application willing to filter, block or just recognize DNS queries to the expanding
empires of big companies which nowadays accept connections via a variety of hostnames rather than just a domain,
be it for CDN/round-robin operations, to distribute load or to deceive clients.

# Organization

The list is organized in files: each file has the name of the conglomerate (i.e. "facebook") and the file contains
a newline separated list of domains belonging to the conglomerate.

# Contributing
